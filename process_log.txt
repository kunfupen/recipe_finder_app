REFLECTION
================================================================================

Most useful AI assistance:
- Debugging
- Understanding a certain term or function better
- How certain things can be done in a certain way

What I would do differently:
- I would plan the layout and structure of the detail page before coding it.
- I would try to understand the API documentation a little bit better before
starting so I would know what each of the fields do.
